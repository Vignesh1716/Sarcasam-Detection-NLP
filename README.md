# Sarcasam-Detection---NLP
Building a model using NLP techniques to detect the sarcasm

Data Description: 
News Headlines dataset for Sarcasm Detection. The dataset is collected from two news websites, theonion.com and huffingtonpost.com. This new dataset has the following advantages over the existing Twitter datasets: Since news headlines are written by professionals in a formal manner, there are no spelling mistakes and informal usage. This reduces the sparsity and also increases the chance of finding pre-trained embedding. Furthermore, since the sole purpose of TheOnion is to publish sarcastic news, we get high-quality labels with much less noise as compared to Twitter datasets. Unlike tweets that reply to other tweets, the news headlines obtained are selfcontained. This would help us in teasing apart the real sarcastic elements.

Content:
Each record consists of three attributes: 
- is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic otherwise 0 
- headline: the headline of the news article 
- article_link: link to the original news article. Useful in collecting supplementary data
